This is a simple proof of concept which displays the capablities of Passport.JS to Verify a local user
and attach the user object to the session state.
Running has been verified and the sessionid cookie can be verified using the debugging tools on chrome after the
login has been performed.

This project uses ejs as the view engine to render the index and the login page. The login page is a simple for
which allows the user to perform the login. After the login has been successfuly pefromed it redirects the user to
Home page without the login link

The Project does not uses any database till now. Pending work includes adding the Database to verify the username and password
Pending work also include to add other passport strategies like Facebook, Twitter.

Thanks and Feedbacks are welcome
